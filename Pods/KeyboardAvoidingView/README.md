Please check [official guide](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

Cartfile:

```
github "APUtils/KeyboardAvoidingView" ~> 5.0
```

Then add both `KeyboardAvoidingView` and `ViewState` frameworks to your project. Remove `APExtensionsViewState` dependency if you previously had it.

#### CocoaPods

KeyboardAvoidingView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "KeyboardAvoidingView", '~> 5.0'
```

## Usage

Just set `KeyboardAvoidingView` class to any view in storyboard (usually it's base container) that you want to adjust it's bottom constraint or frame height to avoid keyboard, **assure module field is also `KeyboardAvoidingView`**.

It's also possible to create it from code:
```swift
let keyboardAvoidingView = KeyboardAvoidingView(frame: containerView.bounds)
keyboardAvoidingView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = true
keyboardAvoidingView.autoresizingMask = [.flexibleWidth, .flexibleHeight]

containerView.addSubview(keyboardAvoidingView)
```

In most cases it should be only one `KeyboardAvoidingView` for screen. Be sure to not create nested `KeyboardAvoidingView`'s.

See example project for more details.
